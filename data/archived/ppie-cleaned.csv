At some point I was questioned about my mental health but that was done in very clinical way and I felt I could not trust the person. Due to tensions with my husband I felt like neonatal nurses were getting too involved. In two occasions two different nurses who were younger than me would sit me down and suggest to get divorced. Only after conversation with a matron and my husband our relationship started to improve. I was very nervous and stressed, that affected my milk supply, but I keept expressing. At the end when going home from neonatal unit I was given bag full with my frozen expressed milk, that made me think that baby has mostly receiving formula. Also after giving birth when they removed me from intensive care to Rowan ward at first I was put in to room with other mums and their babies. That was so painful I started to cry straight away and then I was moved to different room where I did not need to see other mums and babies together. In neonatal unit during lunch time I noticed that other mums would also benefit form someone with mental health support to speak to. They were also traumatised and talking about their experiences. Having someone professional to talk to about emotions I was going through at that moment would have helped me a lot. Also if only my husband would have an option to talk to someone as well at the time it would also had helped. Now everything is fine and looking back I can see that we were in shock and people around us was not very trained to support us. Also discharge was very sudden and I was told on the day that I am going home today with my baby. I obviously was happy but I wish I was prepared for this like maybe days before.
